description: About Minako Williams, the painter
---

Minako is an abstract painter who explores themes related to and inspired by thoughts, principles, and philosophies of existentialism. 

Her paintings are an exploration of secrets within the universe and within different planes of existence. Her work is about the transformation of existential thought into transcendent embodiment in paint and material. 

* What kind of discoveries can be made dissecting the boundaries of mind, body, and soul? 
* What barriers or veils can we pull back or destroy to find the spatial-temporal threshold? 
* How can we embrace the vast and yet uncertain veracity? 

The most critical characteristic that defines her work and process is experimentation. Like how much we know about existing beyond the physical plane, there are forces that are unknown and beyond our control. The focused object or figure within my paintings can change between itself or as part of the background. Most of the art I create is founded by that objective.  

Her artistic interpretation of existence is a collection of possibilities manifesting into numerous forms and designs. By intersecting the connection between existential theory and paint, she brings this discovery to life.
